This repo has an on-going development pipeline for object recognition of a single isolated model in point cloud. The system uses point cloud data generated from a 3D CAD model and describes its characteristics using local feature descriptors. These are then matched with the descriptors of the point cloud data from the scene to find the 6-DoF pose of the model in the robot coordinate frame. This initial pose estimation is then refined by a registration method such as ICP. A robot-camera calibration is performed also. The contributions will be as follows: A system which uses FPFH (Fast Point Feature Histogram) for describing the local region and a hypothesize-and-test paradigm, e.g. RANSAC in the matching process. In contrast to several approaches, those whose rely on Point Pair Features as feature descriptors and a geometry hashing, e.g. voting-scheme as the matching process. By: Casch
